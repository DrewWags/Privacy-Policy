    <h1>Account Deletion for Graadr</h1>
    <p>We believe in giving you full control over your data. You can request the deletion of your Graadr account and all associated data at any time.</p>

    <h2>How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can request account deletion using one of the following methods:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Method 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Graadr app on your device.</li>
        <li>Navigate to your Profile or Settings screen.</li>
        <li>Tap on the "Delete Account" option.</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the deletion. This is the fastest method.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Method 2: Email Request</strong></p>
    <p>If you are unable to access the app, you can send an email to our support team at <strong>support@graadr.com</strong> with the subject line "Account Deletion Request". Please include the username or email address associated with your account so we can identify it.</p>

    <h2>What Happens When Your Account is Deleted?</h2>
    <p>When you request the deletion of your account, the following data will be permanently and irreversibly removed from our systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your user profile (username, email address, etc.)</li>
        <li>All photos you have uploaded</li>
        <li>All ratings you have received</li>
        <li>All ratings you have given to others</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please note that some non-identifiable, anonymized data (such as aggregated app performance metrics) may be retained for analytical purposes. This data cannot be linked back to you in any way.</p>
    
    <p>Account deletion requests are typically processed within 14 business days.</p>
